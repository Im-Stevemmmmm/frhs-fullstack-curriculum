/* Variable declaration! We are saying that we are going to define message and set its value equal to 'Hello world!'.
 *
 * Think of it like math. When we say x = 32, we are just defining a value we can reference by a name.
 * Use single quotes ('') to define a string value, which is just a sequence of characters.
 *
 * Always use names that represent what the variable represents.
 * For example, if we have something to represent the total taxes on an item, lets call
 * that variable taxTotal, instead of abc.
